Title: About Me

I am 2nd year PhD student studying Computational and Integrative Biology at Rutgers University, Camden, NJ. 
I am also a teaching assistant and have taught courses in Computer Science, Biology, and 
Chemistry (click the "Teaching" tab in the header to see a full list of courses). 

I am conducting research under my PhD advisor, Dr. Hao Zhu. My current research interests include the development of 
predictive computational models for complex toxicity end points by using biological assay information. It is our hope that 
these efforts can be used to reduce animal testing. Additionally, with the help from the entire Zhu Research Group, I am 
developing an online cheminformatics portal, called the Chemical In vitro-In vivo Profiling Project, or [CIIPro]('ciipro.rutgers.edu'). 
CIIPro is a web portal for researchers to analyze the potential biological effects of chemicals and export these data 
in a format conducive for research/modeling purposes. More information on CIIPro can be found at ciipro.rutgers.edu, or 
through the Zhu Research Group website (see below). 

I am always open to intra- and interdisciplinary research collaborations. 
Feel free to contact me to talk about current or future works.
