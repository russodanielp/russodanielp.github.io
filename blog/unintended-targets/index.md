A lot of my friends and family are usually shocked when I tell them that when a drug is approved, it's not always known how it works.  [While it certainly helps](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0410-347) increase a drugs' chances, the FDA does not require a formal understanding of a drug's mechanism of action for approval.  How could it? <!-- TEASER_END -->  There are certainly enough diseases we don't fully understand, how could it be expected to know how their therapy works? Indeed, the mechanisms of action of many drugs currently on the market are not really well-understood.  So much there's a (probably non exhaustive) [list of such drugs on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Drugs_with_unknown_mechanisms_of_action). One wildly common example is [acetaminiophen](https://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i29/Does-Acetaminophen-Work-Researchers-Still.html), whose mechanism has been debated pretty exhaustively (ironic that on the other hand its mechanism for liver toxicity is one of the most well-understood). 

While it's one thing to watch a drug progress its way through the pipeline without a solid understanding of whats going on biologically, it's another to find out what you thought was going on....wasn't the case at all.  This was the fate of 8 such drugs at different stages of the clinical progression as published by Science Translational Medicine last week.  These 8 drugs, all cancer drugs, all at different stages of the clinical pipeline, were conclusively shown to not act in the way they were designed.  That is, each of the drugs were designed to act against a particular cancer target.  Well, not only were these drugs shown to have their effects via some other biological route.....the target they were supposedly targeting were also supposedly required for cancer cell survival.  But that just was not the case.  Awesome study that you can read about [here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaw8412).
