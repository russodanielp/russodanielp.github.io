<p>Recently, I needed to make a heatmap with a dendrogram for work.  The only libraries that I could find with that particular template were <a href="https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/">seaborn</a> or <a href="https://plot.ly/">plotly</a>. However, I really like plotting with <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=bokeh%20pyton">bokeh</a>, and after stumbling upon <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23578753/how-to-make-a-cluster-style-dendrogram-in-bokeh">this</a> StackOverflow question, it seemed like no code was available.  The more I program the more I find myself prefering to code graphs myself, so I decided to forgo using a high-level template and instead make my own. Here is a heatmap clustering the MLB teams by batting statistics.<br><!-- TEASER_END -->
