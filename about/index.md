I am 3rd year PhD student studying Computational and Integrative Biology at Rutgers University, Camden, NJ.  My current research interests
include developing predictive models for chemicals to be used in pharmacology and toxicology.  I'm currently interested in how the "Big Data"
landscape can be exploited to aid in chemical risk assessment and identification of drug candidates.  I love discussing science of all types,
but especially biochemistry, pharmacology, machine learning, computer science and data science.  

I am very passionate about scientific communication and teaching.  Scientists who discuss research in a clear, accessible manner are very
inspirational to me.  I blog ([www.danielprusso.com](www.danielprusso.com)), tweet ([@russodanielp](www.twitter.com/russodanielp)), and code ([github.com/russodanielp](www.github.com/russodanielp))
about science and Phillies baseball.  I'm also proud to be a [software-carpentry](www.software-carpentry) instructor!

### Current Projects ###

* [CIIPro](www.github.com/russodanielp/ciipro): The Chemical _In vitro_-_In vivo_ Profiling Project

I'm always open to new projects and feedback!  Feel free to contact me at russodanielp@gmail.com.
