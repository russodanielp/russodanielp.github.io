&lt;p&gt;I don't know how, but at some point in my life I got it in my head that baseball does not have a significant advantage for the home team.  I had heard there were sports where it plays a huge part (the NFL for example) but it was all hearsay.  Baseball for me just always felt immune to it.  I guess when even the best teams have winning percentages barely over .500 through 162 games, there was an air of randomness for any given baseball game.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I needed to make a heatmap with a dendrogram for work.  The only libraries that I could find with that particular template were &lt;a href="https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/"&gt;seaborn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://plot.ly/"&gt;plotly&lt;/a&gt;. However, I really like plotting with &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=bokeh%20pyton"&gt;bokeh&lt;/a&gt;, and after stumbling upon &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23578753/how-to-make-a-cluster-style-dendrogram-in-bokeh"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; StackOverflow question, it seemed like no code was available.  The more I program the more I find myself prefering to code graphs myself, so I decided to forgo using a high-level template and instead make my own. Here is a heatmap clustering the MLB teams by batting statistics.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiles_arbitrary_target_specification"&gt;SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification (SMARTS)&lt;/a&gt; is a language used for pattern searching in molecules.  SMARTS takes its cue from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression"&gt;regular expressions&lt;/a&gt;, which allow for character matching in text strings.  Simply put, a sequence of characters in a regular expression defines a search pattern.  For example, in a regular expression the vertical bar character, |, is boolean operator meaning "or".  Using python's &lt;code&gt;re.py&lt;/code&gt; module we can find matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've always enjoyed presentation and design.  Whether it's nice looking powerpoint slides, neat figures from science articles, album covers, shirts, whatever.  So, when I think about which package in Python I have come to enjoy most, I think it's undoubtedly &lt;a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/"&gt;Bokeh&lt;/a&gt;.  While it's probably not as powerful as matplotlib (no support for 3D plots yet), I think the figures you can create look really stunning.  The plots are produced in JavaScript, so they can be dynamic and integrate easily to the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, I've been making figures using baseball data as practice (I'm sure I'll soon do this with chemical data, too).  I'll probably post a bunch more of these because they're so much fun to create. As a start, I downloaded batting and pitching statistics for all the MLB teams in the 2015 regular season from &lt;a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/"&gt;Baseball Reference&lt;/a&gt;.  The hardest part about generating these graphs was finding the hex color codes for all the MLB teams in some sort of downloadable format.  Luckily, I was able to find them (although I don't remember where).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here a simple plot of batting statistics (batting average, slugging percentage, and on-base percentage) and pitching statistics (earned run average, walks and hits per inning pitched, and strikeouts to walks ratio).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in time, too.  The Phillies played their first spring training game today.&lt;/p&gt;
